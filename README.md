## Accident Risk Prediction  

This project predicts **accident-prone areas** based on **location (latitude & longitude) and time (hour of day)** using a machine learning model.  
A simple **Streamlit web app** is provided to interactively check accident risk at given coordinates and time.

## Features  
- Predicts accident risk probability using **logistic regression**  
- Interactive **Streamlit app** with user inputs (latitude, longitude, hour of day)  
- Data preprocessing includes spatial binning of coordinates

## Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn** – logistic regression model  
- **Streamlit** – interactive web app
